It's an encoding problem: the templates are all utf-8, the expected files are ascii
but the failing one, which is utf-8.

The templates use '`' instead of \code{}, which then translates to UTF-8 
we've got to fix that.

- change string enclosing frm '' to ""
- use checkmate for every function argument
